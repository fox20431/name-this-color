About Name that Color

- Being a typical guy, I have no clue what the colors Lavender and Mauve look like. You can show me Indigo and I won't know if it's more like Violet or Purple. So I made this little app where you can create a color on the screen (or copy-paste CSS hex# color) and find out the name of the closest matching color.
- You can also select from the dropdown list of 1500+ colors and then play around. Here's an improved version of this tool made by Daniel Flueck, Color Name & Hue that is useful especially for colorblind folks.
- The color names in this list were found via Wikipedia, Crayola, and Color-Name Dictionaries like Resene. I removed duplicates and manually edited the list for consistency.
- This tool is simply for fun and personal use. Don't send off that marketing brochure to printers based on this.
